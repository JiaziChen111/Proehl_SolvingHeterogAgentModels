Install the files in a separate directory,
then run main.m

DLL FILES:
The package contains a number of compiled c-files
The distribution contains 
- the .c-files
- the .mexw32 files, compiled for Windows
You may have to uncomment 2 lines in main.m
in order to generate .dll or mexw32 etc. files,
in case the included dll's don't work.
This would have to be done only once.


THE INSTALLATION INCLUDES
a few m-files from the Miranda/Fackler toolkit, available at 
    http://www4.ncsu.edu/~pfackler/compecon/toolbox.html;
This is a very useful package, I recommend to download and look at the
full package, although the folder lib_mirandafackler contains 
all files necessary to run the present project

Have fun!
